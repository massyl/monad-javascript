# Functional programming history

* First high-level FP language Lisp (McCarthy), developed in the late 1950s

* Lisp the seed for functional languages family

* Haskell originally designed in the late 1980s (Hudak, Wadler, 1988), inspired by languages developed by David Turner in the early 1980s.

Named after the logician Haskell B. Curry, with Alonzo Church, established the theoretical foundations of functional programming (Lambda Calculus)


# Introduction

- Immutability is the backbone of all FP programs.

# Reminders

## Higher order functions
